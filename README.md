Feedback Loop project

This project is a SPA that enables a user to input, review, and submit feedback for a set of provided questions.

Using React.js (reducers), Node.js, Postgresql, and CSS, this application is a small example of how to use the 'redux store' to persist data (or a set of data, in this instance) across a set of different DOM views and then submit that data to a SQL database for storage and recall.
